# ECE 239AS.2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2 (Spring 2025)

This repository contains the code for the four projects assigned in **ECE 239AS.2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2**, taught by Prof. Jonathan Kao at UCLA.

**ECE 239AS.2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2** is an advanced graduate-level course at UCLA that builds upon foundational concepts in machine learning and deep learning. The course explores cutting-edge topics and state-of-the-art models in generative modeling and reinforcement learning, with a strong emphasis on hands-on implementation and critical analysis.

Students begin with modern generative techniques such as **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, followed by in-depth studies of **diffusion-based models** for sample generation. The course then transitions into sequence modeling using **transformer architectures**, including attention mechanisms and their applications in natural language processing. Finally, students dive into **deep reinforcement learning**, covering **policy gradients**, **actor-critic methods**, and **Q-learning**.

Coursework is entirely project-based, consisting of four major assignments:

- **GANs and VAEs**: Implementation and comparison of two foundational generative models.
- **Diffusion Models**: Training and evaluation of denoising-based generative techniques.
- **Transformers**: Sequence modeling using self-attention and transformer architectures.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Application of deep RL algorithms to simulated environments.

By the end of the course, students will have developed a portfolio of working implementations of modern deep learning systems and gained practical insights into training stability, performance evaluation, and real-world application design.
