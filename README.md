# ECE 239AS.2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2 (Spring 2025)

This repository contains the code for the four projects assigned in **ECE 239AS.2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2**, taught by Prof. Jonathan Kao at UCLA.

This course explores advanced topics in deep learning with a focus on graph-based methods, probabilistic modeling, and decision-making over structured data. Through four hands-on projects, students will implement and analyze algorithms that span random graph generation, community detection, graph-based reinforcement learning, and classical network algorithms. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using PyTorch.
